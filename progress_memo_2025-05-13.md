## Progress Memo: Sims MUD Project

**Date:** 2025-05-13

**Key Achievements:**

1.  **Improved LLM Response Handling:**
    *   Modified `app.py` to robustly extract the JSON payload from the Ollama LLM's response, even if it includes extraneous text (like `<think>` blocks or other conversational elements). This ensures only the valid JSON is parsed for game state updates.
    *   Updated the corresponding test (`test_llm_json_parsing_error_handling`) in `tests/test_app.py` to reflect the new error message when a JSON block cannot be found.

2.  **Test Environment and Execution:**
    *   Corrected a test case (`test_llm_action_env_object_state_change`) by adding a "Computer" object to the initial game state in `app.py`, allowing the test for environment object state changes to pass.
    *   Refined the Docker Compose command for running tests to `docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --build --exit-code-from test --remove-orphans test`. This command:
        *   Builds the test image.
        *   Runs the tests.
        *   Suppresses logs from other services (like MongoDB), providing cleaner test output.
        *   Exits with the test suite's status code.
        *   Cleans up the test-specific containers.
    *   Updated `README.md` with this improved testing command.

3.  **Overall Stability:**
    *   All automated tests (10 tests) are now passing, indicating a stable state for the current feature set, including LLM interaction mocking, basic game logic, and API endpoints.

**MongoDB Usage in the Game:**

Currently, MongoDB serves as the **persistent data store** for the game world and its inhabitants. It's used to store and manage:

1.  **Sim State (`sims` collection):**
    *   Stores data for each Sim character (currently just "Alex").
    *   Attributes stored include:
        *   `_id` (e.g., "sim_alex")
        *   `name`
        *   `location` (current zone within the apartment)
        *   `mood`
        *   `needs` (dictionary for hunger, energy, social, fun)
        *   `inventory` (list of object IDs the Sim is carrying)
        *   `current_activity`

2.  **Environment Objects (`environment_objects` collection):**
    *   Stores data for all interactable objects within the game world.
    *   Attributes for each object include:
        *   `_id` (e.g., "obj_bed", "obj_fridge", "obj_computer")
        *   `name` (e.g., "Bed", "Fridge")
        *   `zone` (where the object is currently located, e.g., "Sleeping Area", "Kitchenette", or an inventory ID like "inventory_sim_alex")
        *   `current_state_key` (e.g., "made" for a bed, "closed" for a fridge, "off" for a computer)
        *   `states` (a dictionary of possible states and their textual descriptions)
        *   `interactions` (a list of verbs/actions possible with the object)
        *   `contains` (for container objects like the Fridge, a list of object IDs it holds)
        *   `properties` (custom data like `edible`, `capacity_ml`)

3.  **Apartment Layout (`apartment_layout` collection):**
    *   Stores the structure and description of the game environment (currently "Alex's Studio Apartment").
    *   Includes:
        *   `_id`
        *   `name`
        *   `zones` (a dictionary where each key is a zone name, e.g., "Living Area"):
            *   `description` of the zone.
            *   `connections` to other zones.
            *   `coordinates` (placeholder for potential future grid-based movement).

**How it's used during gameplay:**

*   **Initialization:** When the Flask app starts (or tests run), `initialize_game_world()` populates these collections with the default game state if they are empty.
*   **Action Handling (`/game/action`):**
    1.  When a player performs an action, `get_current_game_state()` fetches the relevant Sim's state, objects in their current zone, and their inventory from MongoDB.
    2.  This data is used to construct the prompt for the LLM.
    3.  After the LLM responds (with JSON), the Python backend parses this JSON.
    4.  Updates derived from the LLM's response (changes to Sim's needs, mood, location, inventory; changes to environment objects' states, locations, or container contents) are written back to the respective collections in MongoDB using update operations (`$set`, `$addToSet`, `$pull`, etc.).
*   **State Retrieval (`/game/full_state`):** This endpoint directly queries MongoDB to fetch and return the complete current state of the Sim, all environment objects, and the apartment layout.

Essentially, MongoDB acts as the "single source of truth" for the game's state, ensuring that changes are persisted and consistently reflected across different parts of the application and between player actions.
